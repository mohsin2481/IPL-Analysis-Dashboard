# IPL-Analysis-Dashboard📊
1.⚡🏏 IPL Insights Dashboard: Tableau Analysis of IPL Trends and Performances
An interactive Tableau dashboard built to explore Indian Premier League (IPL) data—highlighting team champions, top performers, scoring trends (sixes/fours), toss decision impacts, and head-to-head win patterns across seasons.
(Includes a small Tableau logo icon next to the title when embedding in HTML/Markdown:
or use 📊 to denote Tableau visuals.)

2. Short Description / Purpose
The IPL Insights Dashboard is a visually engaging and analytical Tableau report designed to help cricket analysts, commentators, team strategists, and enthusiastic fans dive into IPL match data across all seasons. It surfaces key metrics like title winners 🏆, Orange Cap (highest run-scorer) 🎖️, Purple Cap (highest wicket-taker) 🎗️, overall sixes/fours tally 💥, and the influence of toss decisions on match outcomes.

3. Tech Stack 📊🛠️
📊 Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public – Main visualization platform used to build and publish the dashboard.

🛠️ Data Preparation Tools – Data cleaning/transformation in Excel and/or Python (Pandas) to shape match- and player-level datasets into Tableau-ready extracts.

🔢 Calculated Fields & Parameters in Tableau – For dynamic KPIs (e.g., season selector, computed totals, win percentages).

📁 Data Source Files – CSV/Excel extracts (e.g., Kaggle IPL dataset containing matches, players, ball-by-ball details).

☁️ Hosting – Published to Tableau Public for sharing; can embed in blogs or GitHub README with Tableau embed code or snapshot images.
4. Data Source 📂
Primary IPL Dataset

Matches table: season, match ID, teams, toss winner/decision, match winner, margin, venue, etc.

Player-season aggregates: total runs by player, total wickets by player.

Optional Ball-by-Ball Data 🎯

Used to compute total sixes/fours per season or by team.

Supplementary Metadata 🏷️

Team logos/names (normalize across seasons), season info (year, final match).

Preparation Steps

Clean & Normalize: harmonize team names (e.g., “Delhi Daredevils” → “Delhi Capitals”).

Aggregate Stats: compute Orange Cap (highest run-scorer) and Purple Cap (highest wicket-taker) per season.

Summarize Wins: tally match wins by team, split by batting-first vs. fielding-first.

Compute Totals: total sixes and fours per season (or overall if “All” selected).

5. Features / Highlights ✨
🎯 Business Problem
IPL data is rich but manual analysis is slow:

Which teams dominated in a given season or overall?

Who led in runs/wickets each year?

How have sixes/fours trends evolved?

Does toss decision (bat vs. field) influence win rates?

🎯 Goal
Build an interactive Tableau dashboard for:

Filtering by season (or “All”) to surface key outcomes.

Displaying season champion, Orange Cap, Purple Cap, sixes/fours totals.

Analyzing toss-decision impact on wins, and team-specific batting-first vs. field-first performance.
